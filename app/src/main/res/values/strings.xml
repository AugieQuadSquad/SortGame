    <string name="bubblesortinstructions">Hello! Welcome to the Quad Squad Bubble Sort Game! To skip this tutorial, press the next button at the bottom of the page!\n\nBubble Sort is a technique used by computers to sort a list. This sort always starts at the far left of the list and moves right through comparing two items at a time. It starts with the first and second item, and if the first one is bigger than the second item, then it switches the two! It then moves to the second and third item and if the second is bigger than the third item, it swaps them. It will continue down the list, checking the two neighboring items until it gets to the end of the list. Then it will start back at the far left and repeat the process over again! As you may find, this sorting method is somewhat slow and involves a lot of checks. Let's see how well you can Bubble Sort like a Computer!! Click the next button below to begin! </string>
