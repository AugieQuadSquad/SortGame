# SortGame
This app is a game to teach kids different sorting algorithms!! There are three types of sorts that we have created into games. Bubble sort, Selection sort, and Insertion sort. There are instructions before each game to teach the player how to sort. It uses a game board class which is expandable for any sort by calling separate models that populate the list of correct moves. We also have a separate class for the high scores and to display the instructions. Devon White and Catherine Cross did the majority of the fundamental coding. Michael and Luke Currie added the SelectionSort model class. Everyone decided the main concept and general design of the app.
